        <h2><span class="section">Casl Blue</span></h2>
        <p class="firstp">What started in 2012 as a script for podcast management has since evolved into a full scale delivery platform for music producers and consumers. Full release planned for the midyear of 2015.</p>
        <p>While we aren't the first ones to tackle this problem (and won't be the last), our approach will set us apart. As long-standing members of the community we aim to serve with Casl Blue, we've been observing and analyzing the current solutions for some time. We will be formalizing what works within the community and putting the tools in place for the community to control the evolution of the platform over time.</p>
        <p>As longtime consumers of the content we understand the desires from the consumption-side of the equation. In building the consumer functionality we were faced with the other side of problem, producers and their compensation. The end of 2014 was spent researching how this side of the problem has been solved and what constraints are placed on possible solutions, e.g. international copyright law.</p>
        <p>We believe brining some open-source mentality, a little engineering novelty, and the communal attitude of those we aim to serve we allow us to solve both sides of the equation in the most efficient form possible.</p>

        <p><b>The observation:</b>
<br>The Internet provides the ultimate means for collaboration and possibly the lowest barrier for learning in history. While these means are being leveraged through an ever-expanding collection tools, the implementation is often a legacy method adapted to modern technologies. These tools often provide an impressive amount of information with an abundance of availability, but they don't truly exploit the modern levels of computation and collaboration available.</p>
        <p><b>The bird's-eye plan:</b>
<br>The variety of solutions readily available will be discussed, endorsed, and heavily used. This project is better defined as a goal, a goal of finding the crowning open knowledge tool. There are a multitude of paths we would like to explore, the hope is a collaborative community will help decide which are worth  pursuing and in what manner.</p>

        <p><span class="section">Developing Ideas:</span></p>
        <p>Creating the tools for modeling the concepts presented in Thomas Kuhn's <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a></i>. Scalable knowledge exploration from paradigms through the “inaccessible” normal science.  </p>
        <p>A holism approach to a time-based epistemology, built by community collaboration and version control. With efficient reductionism tools for exploring topics beyond their bird's-eye presentation. </p>
        <p>Using graph theory to create explanatory representations of data intensive justification of knowledge. Starting with bioinformatics and expanding to all areas of active scientific research by normalizing data structures and visualization methods.</p>

        <p>Still in the early stages but now there is a place for ideas to reach a critical mass. Additional research of current methods, areas for their improvement, and discussion of new concepts coming soon! All community contributions are encouraged.

        <h2><span class="section">The Typographic Mind</span></h2>
        <p class="firstp">Neil Postman's <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death">Amusing Ourselves to Death</a></i> has doubtlessly inspired countless conversations, thought experiments, and self reflections. While many interpretations are possible, the message and discussion presented in Chapter 4, The Typographic Mind, have resonated with me for sometime. </p>
        <p>If a mind dedicated to communicating through the printed medium has some unique qualities, can we capture those qualities using modern technologies? While I might not be focused on the exact qualities Postman speaks to in his book, the idea of a mind specialized in gaining information through a typographic medium is certainly an interesting topic. </p>
        <p>Closely related to, and consistently overlapping with, the <a href="#OE">Open Epistemology</a> project, The Typographic Mind looks to explore knowledge and learning. The question this project aims to investigate:  </p>
        <p><i>Is it possible to use concept-mapping across typographic mediums to gain additional insight to the subjectivity of human knowledge?</i></p>
        <p>A collaborator has recently started a code base for this project, we are looking for funding to fall into place or a burst of clarity within the problem scope (without putting in the required time and effort to reach such an epiphany). But with a topic this intriguing you can plan to see progress in 2015.</p>

      <div id="NPR" class="jumbotron">
        <h2><span class="section">Why I Hate NPR</span></h2>
        <p class="firstp"></p>
        <p>The name of this project originated when my frustration resulted in completing my daily commute in silence after a certain segment on NPR. As this became more frequent, I would investigate other individuals' reactions via the commenting section available on <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR.org</a>. Typical of commenting sections across the Internet there is nearly zero productivity or discussion, just finger pointing and opinion stating; I really needed something more. </p>
        <p>You might ask why be so critical of NPR, the answer is I believe deeply in the service they provide. As with anything I'm passionate about, I hold opinions how it should function; my subjective version of right and wrong. <a href="#TTM">The Typographic Mind</a> project demonstrates the influence Postman's book had on me, through his work I found Marshall McLuhan's “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">The medium is the message</a>”; which I agree directly applies to modern news media. As an avid reader of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>'s work I began to connect McLuhan's statement with its effect on the masses. </p>
        <p>Being a (small-scale) donor of NPR I began to wonder if there could be a sort of feedback loop for NPR programming. Money influences everything it touches, why can't my money influence the programming I'm supporting? Does money need to be the driver for change (hopefully not) or can a community come together and create a self-fulfilling goals? I'm of the opinion the latter is quite possible with today's technologies.</p>
        <p>While commenting sections never seem to produce anything valuable or concrete, I believe its a problem of the medium used for communication (one could argue its the input from commenters that is lacking, but we'll assume that's incorrect). Could a new medium produce a problem solving discussion that aims to improve it's own context while also improving the people using it? If the medium is built with the improvement of NPR at its core, it should also increase support and funding for programming in parallel with the aforementioned aspirations.</p>
        <p>It's starting to take shape, <a href="http://www.whyihatenpr.com">WhyIHateNPR.com</a> is coming soon.</p>

The projects we undertake can typically be described as CAS, often they involve the Logistical management of data across different Media, e.g. the Internet. Also, the availability of the domain CaslMedia.com helped in the decision with some quick Wikipedia references. </p>
        <p>
        "The term complex adaptive systems, or complexity science, is often used to describe the loosely organized academic field that has grown up around the study of such systems. Complexity science is not a single theory— it encompasses more than one theoretical framework and is highly interdisciplinary, seeking the answers to some fundamental questions about living, adaptable, changeable systems."

        <p>Originally formed to support the legal dealings of Casl Blue. Soon expanded to handle multiple projects due to the Founder and CEO, J.E.Clevenger's complete lack of focus on a single project. Could be described as a think-tank for its members in the form of an umbrella-esque LLC. We are trying to bring our projects to life, some of them require substantial resources or collaboration, the Company was formed to help with this. The members would like to focus on the engineering and leave the business side to the Company. </p>
        <p>Our current team consists of a mechanical engineer in Wisconsin, a full-stack engineer in Arizona, and a database administrator in Wisconsin. We are (currently) a small but capable team, our motivation spawns from the same principles our projects are built on. The balance of time and funding is our only limitation. </p>
        <p>We are always looking to add the right people, typically timing is a significant obstruction. </p>
        <p>(The first-person narrative across this site comes from J.E.Clevenger and should be eliminated as collaboration shapes each project.)</p>
