        <h2><span class="section">Casl Blue</span></h2>
        <p class="firstp">What started in 2012 as a script for podcast management has since evolved into a full scale delivery platform for music producers and consumers. Full release planned for the midyear of 2015.</p>
        <p>While we aren't the first ones to tackle this problem (and won't be the last), our approach will set us apart. As long-standing members of the community we aim to serve with Casl Blue, we've been observing and analyzing the current solutions for some time. We will be formalizing what works within the community and putting the tools in place for the community to control the evolution of the platform over time.</p>
        <p>As longtime consumers of the content we understand the desires from the consumption-side of the equation. In building the consumer functionality we were faced with the other side of problem, producers and their compensation. The end of 2014 was spent researching how this side of the problem has been solved and what constraints are placed on possible solutions, e.g. international copyright law.</p>
        <p>We believe brining some open-source mentality, a little engineering novelty, and the communal attitude of those we aim to serve we allow us to solve both sides of the equation in the most efficient form possible.</p>

        <h2><span class="section">The Typographic Mind</span></h2>
        <p class="firstp">Neil Postman's <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death">Amusing Ourselves to Death</a></i> has inspired countless conversations, thought experiments, and self reflections. While many interpretations are possible, the message and discussion presented in Chapter 4, The Typographic Mind, require additional reflection.</p>
        <p>If a mind dedicated to communicating through the printed medium has some unique qualities, can we capture those qualities using modern technologies? This project may not be focused on the point-for-point qualities Postman speaks to in his book, but the idea of a mind specialized in gaining information through a typographic medium is certainly an interesting topic.</p>
        <p>Closely related to, and consistently overlapping with, the <a href="#OE">Open Epistemology</a> project. This project aims to investigate knowledge and learning through the question:</p>
        <p><i>Is it possible to use concept-graphing across typographic mediums to gain additional insight to the subjectivity of human knowledge?</i></p>

        <h2><span class="section">Why I Hate NPR</span></h2>
        <p class="firstp"></p>
        <p>The name of this project originated when my frustration resulted in completing my daily commute in silence after a certain segment on NPR. As this became more frequent, I would investigate other individuals' reactions via the commenting section available on <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR.org</a>. Typical of commenting sections across the Internet there is nearly zero productivity or discussion, just finger pointing and opinion stating; I really needed something more. </p>
        <p>You might ask why be so critical of NPR, the answer is I believe deeply in the service they provide. As with anything I'm passionate about, I hold opinions how it should function; my subjective version of right and wrong. <a href="#TTM">The Typographic Mind</a> project demonstrates the influence Postman's book had on me, through his work I found Marshall McLuhan's “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">The medium is the message</a>”; which I agree directly applies to modern news media. As an avid reader of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>'s work I began to connect McLuhan's statement with its effect on the masses. </p>
        <p>Being a (small-scale) donor of NPR I began to wonder if there could be a sort of feedback loop for NPR programming. Money influences everything it touches, why can't my money influence the programming I'm supporting? Does money need to be the driver for change (hopefully not) or can a community come together and create a self-fulfilling goals? I'm of the opinion the latter is quite possible with today's technologies.</p>
        <p>While commenting sections never seem to produce anything valuable or concrete, I believe its a problem of the medium used for communication (one could argue its the input from commenters that is lacking, but we'll assume that's incorrect). Could a new medium produce a problem solving discussion that aims to improve it's own context while also improving the people using it? If the medium is built with the improvement of NPR at its core, it should also increase support and funding for programming in parallel with the aforementioned aspirations.</p>
        <p>It's starting to take shape, <a href="http://www.whyihatenpr.com">WhyIHateNPR.com</a> is coming soon.</p>

        <p class="firstp">In the era of [insert adjective] data there is constant discussion on how humans should handle data. How should we use it, share it, learn from it?</p>
        <p>The ultimate use of data is to aid in decision making. For example, drawing conclusions from <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analysis/">analysis</a> through <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/">reductionism</a> is a standard practice in data science. Determining the significance of conclusions relative to the concepts being explored is practicing synthesis. These are the philosophical summaries of a broad range of methods. Our Publishing platform aims to standardize sharing, learning, and usage of data across these methods.</p>

        <p>The name started as an acronym for Complex Adaptive Systems, which is linked to complexity science; a growing field I find fascinating. The projects we undertake can typically be described as CAS, often they involve the Logistical management of data across different Media, e.g. the Internet. Also, the availability of the domain CaslMedia.com helped in the decision with some quick Wikipedia references. </p>
        <p>
        "The term complex adaptive systems, or complexity science, is often used to describe the loosely organized academic field that has grown up around the study of such systems. Complexity science is not a single theory— it encompasses more than one theoretical framework and is highly interdisciplinary, seeking the answers to some fundamental questions about living, adaptable, changeable systems."

        <p>Originally formed to support the legal dealings of Casl Blue. Soon expanded to handle multiple projects due to the Founder and CEO, J.E.Clevenger's complete lack of focus on a single project. Could be described as a think-tank for its members in the form of an umbrella-esque LLC. We are trying to bring our projects to life, some of them require substantial resources or collaboration, the Company was formed to help with this. The members would like to focus on the engineering and leave the business side to the Company. </p>
        <p>Our current team consists of a mechanical engineer in Wisconsin, a full-stack engineer in Arizona, and a database administrator in Wisconsin. We are (currently) a small but capable team, our motivation spawns from the same principles our projects are built on. The balance of time and funding is our only limitation. </p>
        <p>We are always looking to add the right people, typically timing is a significant obstruction. </p>
        <p>(The first-person narrative across this site comes from J.E.Clevenger and should be eliminated as collaboration shapes each project.)</p>
